# DevOps Repository Migration Lab

## Overview

This lab provides hands-on experience with modifying code in a DevOps environment and migrating content between repositories while preserving commit history. Participants will work with a simple weather application, make code changes, and practice repository migration techniques.

## Lab Files

- **README.md**: Step-by-step instructions for participants
- **index.html**: Initial HTML file for the weather app
- **styles.css**: Initial CSS file for the weather app
- **script.js**: Initial JavaScript file for the weather app
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md**: Quick reference guide for Git commands and code modifications
- **INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.md**: Additional information for instructors

## Solution Files

The `solution` folder contains the expected final state of the modified files:
- **solution/styles.css**: CSS file after UI color updates
- **solution/script.js**: JavaScript file after adding temperature conversion

## Lab Structure

The lab is divided into the following parts:

1. **Setting Up the Initial Repository**: Creating and populating the first repository
2. **Making Code Modifications**: Making and committing specific changes to the code
3. **Creating a New Repository**: Setting up a destination repository
4. **Migrating the Code with History**: Moving code while preserving commit history
5. **Advanced Migration (Optional)**: More complex migration scenarios using git-filter-repo

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, participants will be able to:
- Create and manage Git repositories in a DevOps environment
